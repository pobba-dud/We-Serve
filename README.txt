Developers:
make sure u make consistant comments 
and label you commits as it makes it easy for 
anyone else working on the projects to modify
to enable a less arduious development

(I hate comments too but itll help 
everyone working on this project)
make sure to use header, footer, main, and nav tags to increase the organization in the html code
