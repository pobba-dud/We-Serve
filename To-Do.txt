Color Coding for Events
Enable users to assign colors to different types of events for better visual differentiation.

Mobile Responsiveness
Ensure the calendar is mobile-friendly, possibly creating a dedicated mobile layout or app.

Customizable Themes

Custom Event Links
Allow users to generate unique links for events that can be shared with others for easy access.

Analytics Dashboard
Create an analytics dashboard for users to view statistics about their events (e.g., number of events per month, most common event types)(likely to be in account page or in hours).
